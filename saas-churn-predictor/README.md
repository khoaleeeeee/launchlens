# SaaS Churn Predictor for SMBs

> Early warning system for customer churn - built for SaaS companies under $1M ARR

## 🎯 The Problem
Small SaaS companies lose 5-10% of customers monthly but only find out when it's too late. Enterprise tools cost $2000+/month while free tools don't prevent churn.

## 💡 The Solution
$99/month churn prediction that monitors customer behavior, identifies at-risk users, and tells you exactly how to save them.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saas-churn-predictor
cd saas-churn-predictor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Market Validation
