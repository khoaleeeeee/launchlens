### Cold Outreach
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s churn

Hi [Name],

Saw you hit $[X]K MRR with [Company] - awesome milestone!

Quick question: How are you currently predicting which customers might churn?

I'm building a tool that alerts you 30 days before customers cancel and tells you exactly how to save them. It's $99/month and takes 5 min to set up.

Worth a quick chat if you're losing more than 1 customer/month?

[Your name]
P.S. Already works with Stripe - you'd see results tomorrow.
```

### Beta Invite
```
Subject: Your churn prevention tool is ready

Hi [Name],

Remember when we talked about [specific pain point they mentioned]?

I built exactly what you described:
- Alerts you before customers churn (not after)
- Tells you what action to take
- 5-minute Stripe integration
- $49/month for beta users (normally $99)

Want to be one of my first 10 users?

Here's a 5-min demo: [Loom link]

[Your name]
```

### Referral Request
```
Subject: ðŸŽ‰ You prevented 3 churns this month!

Hi [Name],

Your ChurnPredictor dashboard shows you saved 3 customers this month - that's $[amount] in saved MRR!

Quick favor: Do you know any other SaaS founders who might benefit from this?

For each referral who signs up, you both get a month free.

Just have them mention your name when signing up.

[Your name]
P.S. Your NPS response of 10/10 made my day ðŸ™Œ

## Objection Handling

### "How is this different from ProfitWell?"
"ProfitWell shows you metrics. We tell you which customer to call today and what to offer them. It's prevention, not just reporting."

### "I don't have time for another tool"
"It takes 5 minutes to set up and then runs on autopilot. You only get notified when action is needed - maybe 2-3 times per week."

### "$99/month is expensive"
"What's your average customer worth? If this prevents just one churn per year, it's paid for itself 10x over."

### "How do I know it works?"
"Track your churn rate before and after. Most customers see 20-30% reduction in churn within 60 days. If not, cancel anytime."

### "We're too small for this"
"Actually, you're perfect. Enterprise tools cost $2000+/month. We built this specifically for companies your size."
